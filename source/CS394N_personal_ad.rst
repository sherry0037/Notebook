My research areas: Machine Learning & Natual Language Processing. I also have a background in Statistics and Mathematical Modeling.

I have hidden talents in playing video games :)

Three potential topics I'd be interested in working on are:

(1) Natual Language Understanding: solve multiple choices problems like those in TOEFL or IELTS.

(2) Machine translation: how to maintain writing style when translating literature? How to translate poetries?

(3) Solve problems with few data: transfer learning? pretraining? other methods?

Also open to other suggestions.
